sixth O

last O

at O
the O
Hamlet B-MISC

" O
I O
realised O
this O

, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O

successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O

I O
felt O

all O

" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O

as O
the O

Just O
three O

Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O

, O
with O
a O

six O
after O

winning O
three O

But O
Medvedev B-PER

ranking O
slowly O
began O

a O

I O
would O

" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O

" O

It O
's O
a O
part O

" O

As O

Medvedev B-PER

While O

the O

launched O
his O
strongest O

on O
the O
right-wing O

The O
