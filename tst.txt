its O

Kubo B-PER
said O
it O
did O
not O
necessarily O
show O
a O

of O

" O

" O
I O
do O

a O
conclusion O

the O
protection O

the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE B-MISC
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British B-MISC
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O

14,000 O

cases O
of O

before O

British B-MISC
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O

dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-ORG
Farmers I-ORG
Union I-ORG
president O
Sir O
David B-PER
Naish I-PER
told O
BBC B-ORG
radio I-ORG
. O

Naish B-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European B-MISC
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British B-MISC
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE B-MISC
and O
the O
human O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O
in O
March O
when O
government O
scientists O
admitted O
that O
people O
could O
become O
infected O
with O
Creutzfeldt-Jakob B-MISC

from O

he O

" O
I O

our O

judgment O

that O

" O
It O

Hope B-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O

is O
the O
first O

has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O

equally O
we O

the O

it O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O

when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O

the O

Rubin B-PER
's O
predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
, O
Lloyd B-PER
Bentsen I-PER
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O
by O
some O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O
the O

to O
gain O
an O
edge O
in O
trade O
negotiations O
with O
Japan B-LOC

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O

" O
said O
Chris B-PER
Widness I-PER
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER
, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O

Rubin B-PER
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall B-LOC

, O
part O
of O

spent O
as O
co-chairman O

" O
Rubin B-PER
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PER
Faust I-PER
, O
a O
portfolio O
manager O
at O
Bailard B-ORG
, I-ORG
Biehl I-ORG

Kaiser I-ORG
, O
which O
manages O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era B-MISC
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O
. O

Some O
overseas O
investors O
might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. B-LOC
stocks O
and O

or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness B-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan I-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
" O
said O
Widness B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B-LOC
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O

first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O

your O

. O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O

exactly O
